            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now it is euident that Chriſt was ſent of the Father into the world, not, to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance, and to ſaue the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the ſame was prophecied of him, by the holy Ghoſt long before his Incarnation. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. &amp;c. And when Chriſt himſelfe came <hi>to Nazareth,</hi> where he had beene brought vp, he went (as his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was) into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and the Booke of this Propheſie beeing deliuered of the Miniſter vnto him,<note place="margin">Luke, 4.21.</note> he expounded the ſame: The Spirit of the Lord is vpon mee, becauſe hee hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynted me, that I ſhould preach the Goſpell to the poore: he hath ſent me, that I ſhould heale the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearted, that I ſhould preach deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering of ſight to the blind, that I ſhould ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed, and that I ſhould preach the acceptable yeere of the Lord. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16.17.18.19. Hence it is euident that our bleſsed Sauiour was ſent of God the Father not for his owne cauſe, but for his afflicted members ſake, neither came
<pb facs="tcp:11795:6"/>he to bee Lord ouer all, but to redeeme all his owne. So God the Farher deliuered all things vnto him,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.27.</note> hee gaue him all power both in heauen and in earth,<note place="margin">C. 28.18.</note> and made him Lord ouer all; that hee might deliuer vs wretched ſoules from the iawes of hell, and pull vs out of the pawes of that infernall Lion Satan, whoſe bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues we were, ſitting in darkneſse, and in the region and ſhadow of death,<note place="margin">Iſay. 9.1.</note> till that day ſpring from on high viſites vs, and ſet vs at libertie.
